My personal config files, managed with this [method of managing config files](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

### Config Files

These are the config files currently used on my Mac:

* [ZSH](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh) - The Z shell. (~/.zshrc)
* [WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) - A terminal emulator. (~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua)

Other config files that I use but have not uploaded to GitHub:
<!-- TODO: upload these to GitHub -->

* [] [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) - A package manager for macOS.
* [] [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - A community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.
* [] [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - A Vim-fork focused on extensibility and usability.
